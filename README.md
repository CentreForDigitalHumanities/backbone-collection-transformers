## Rationale


[backbone]: https://backbonejs.org/

## Quickstart

We recommend a workflow in which you install dependencies from [npm](https://npmjs.com/) and bundle them with a tool such as Rollup.

``` bash
// could also use yarn, pnpm, etcetera
npm add @uu-cdh/backbone-collection-transformers
```

``` javascript
```

You can also use the library directly from a browser embed, but you may need to set up [import maps][import-map] in that case.

[import-map]: https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap
[ts-mixin]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/mixins.html

## Compatibility

The code modules use modern `import`/`export` syntax. If your target environment does not support this, you will need to take the code through a conversion or bundling tool first. Otherwise, only syntax is used that has existed for a while, so no transpilation or polyfilling should be required.
